        20. Dispute resolution
      </h1>
      <h1 className="heading-45">Informal Negotiations</h1>
      <p className="paragraph-terms-1">
        To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
        or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively,
        the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and
        collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to
        negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
        informally for at least ninety (90) days before initiating arbitration.
        Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party
        to the other Party.
      </p>
      <h1 className="heading-45">Binding Arbitration</h1>
      <p className="paragraph-terms-1">
        If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
        negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
        below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding
        arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE
        THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall
        be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
        American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the
        AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
        Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website:{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">
          www.adr.org
        </Link>
        . Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall
        be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by
        the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator
        to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The
        arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
        documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in
        writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
        either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award
        may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
        otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the
        arbitration will take place in United States , Delaware. Except as
        otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
        arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
        modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
        arbitrator.
        <br />
        <br />
        If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
        the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
        courts located in United States, Delaware, and the Parties hereby
        consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and
        forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such
        state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention
        on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform
        Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these
        Terms of Use.
        <br />
        <br />
        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
        Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
        this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute
        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
        listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
        personal jurisdiction of that court.
      </p>
      <h1 className="heading-45">Restrictions</h1>
      <p className="paragraph-terms-1">
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
        (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
        class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
        persons.

        Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
      </h1>
      <p className="paragraph-terms-1">
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
        arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
        concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a
        Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
        theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
        claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
        falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
        unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
